Goal:
The goal of the problem is to predict whether a passenger was delighted considering his/her overall travel experience of traveling in Shinkansen (Bullet Train). For each passenger id in the test set, you must predict the “Overall_Experience” level.

Dataset

The problem consists of 2 separate datasets: Travel data & Survey data. The Travel data has information related to passengers and the performance of the Train in which they traveled. The survey data is the aggregated data of surveys collected post-service experience. You are expected to treat both the datasets as raw data and perform any necessary cleaning/validation steps as required.

Metric to measure

Your score is the percentage of all correct predictions made by you. This is simply known as accuracy. The best accuracy is 1 whereas the worst is 0. It will be calculated as the total number of two correct predictions (True positive + True negative) divided by the total number of observations in the dataset.

Submission File Format:

You should submit a CSV file with exactly 35602 entries plus a header row.

The file should have exactly two columns

·         ID ( sorted in any order)

·         Overall_Experience (contains 0 & 1, 1 represents delighted)

Working with Data

Data has been split into two groups and provided in the module:

·         train dataset

·         test dataset 

The training set is used to build your machine learning model. For the training set, we provide the Overall_Experience level for each participant.

The test set should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, it is your job to predict the “Overall Experience” level for each participant.
